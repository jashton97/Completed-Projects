Hangman V1

This game is standalone. Just run Hangman.exe to play.

NOTE: This game was created in the earliest days of my programming career, so the may be bugs.

NOTE2: Do not tick the box in the upper right corner labelled "Enable Easter Egg", if you are easy to scare. The easter egg
is a jumpscare from a game that appears as a name in the list. The jumpscare is disabled if the box isn't ticked.
